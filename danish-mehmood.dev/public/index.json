This presents different challenges and trade offs, we have to carefully manage these tradeoffs, there are different patterns which the industry leaders in microservices have comeup with which manage the tradeoffs really well in live environments. But still when deciding on the communication patterns for your microservices you have to pay painstaking attention to detail. Because you have to remember these communication patterns are playing with tradeoffs and you have to choose which fits best you design goals and business domain.

They convert the application modules which were present in monolith to the services and then simply try to convert the inter module function calls in monolith to the RPC calls in microservices. This happens because the engineers have wrong assumptions about microservices (or distributed systems). They are still assuming somethings which they assumed for monolithic architecture like they have a reliable network (which is not true, networks are never reliable) and another assumption thy could be making is latency is still zero just like in monoliths, both assumptions are far from truth, and these false assumptions and many other fallacies are coverd in wikipedia entry Fallacies of distributed computing. If you translate all the inter module function calls to RPC calls, your services would be very chatty, which is the last thing we want. In a monolith network was not being used to communicate unlike microservices, and every call now on the network has a latency which we want to reduce.

Initially, those types of communications can be classified in two axes. The first axis defines if the protocol is synchronous or asynchronous: HTTP is a synchronous protocol for communication. The client sends the request and waits for the response to continue. Even if the http requests are being pipelined 1, even then the responses will be in sequence and the client which sent the request has to wait to get the response and would only then continue doing some thing else, you can think of it as a blocking communication mechanism. Protocols like AMQP2 are asynchronous, In this type of communication the client sends the message/request and does not wait for the response from the reciever(s) to continue doing other things (you can think of this like email communication). The second axis defines if the communication has a single receiver or multiple receivers: Single receiver. Each request must be processed by exactly one receiver or service. An example of this communication is the Command pattern. Multiple receivers. Each request can be processed by zero to multiple receivers. This type of communication must be asynchronous. An example is the publish/subscribe mechanism used in patterns like Event-driven architecture. This is based on an event-bus interface or message broker when propagating data updates between multiple microservices through events; it’s usually implemented through a service bus or similar artifact. don’t get bogged down by the different concepts like pub/sub and event-driven architecture, i will go into the detail of how these things work. A microservice-based application will often use a combination of these communication styles. The most common type is single-receiver communication with a synchronous protocol like HTTP/HTTPS when invoking a regular Web API HTTP service. Microservices also typically use messaging protocols for asynchronous communication between microservices. These axes are good to know so you have clarity on the possible communication mechanisms, but they’re not the important concerns when building microservices. Neither the asynchronous nature of client thread execution nor the asynchronous nature of the selected protocol are the important points when integrating microservices. What is important is being able to integrate your microservices asynchronously while maintaining the independence of microservices. ","date":"2024-12-04","objectID":"/microservices-architecture-deep-dive-part-three-communications/:4:0","tags":["microservices","distributed systems"],"title":"Microservices Architecture Deep Dive Part Three: Communications","uri":"/microservices-architecture-deep-dive-part-three-communications/"},{"categories":["microservices"],"content":"Asynchronous Integration As mentioned, the important point when building a microservices-based application is the way you integrate your microservices. Ideally, you should try to minimize the communication between the internal microservices. The fewer communications between microservices, the better. But in many cases, you’ll have to somehow integrate the microservices. When you need to do that, the critical rule here is that the communication between the microservices should be asynchronous. That doesn’t mean that you have to use a specific protocol (for example, asynchronous messaging versus synchronous HTTP). It just means that the communication between microservices should be done only by propagating data asynchronously, but try not to depend on other internal microservices as part of the initial service’s HTTP request/response operation. If possible, never depend on synchronous communication (request/response) between multiple microservices, not even for queries. The goal of each microservice is to be autonomous and available to the client consumer, even if the other services that are part of the end-to-end application are down or unhealthy. If you think you need to make a call from one microservice to other microservices (like performing an HTTP request for a data query) to be able to provide a response to a client application, you have an architecture that won’t be resilient when some microservices fail. Moreover, having HTTP dependencies between microservices, like when creating long request/response cycles with HTTP request chains, as shown in the first part of the Figure 4-15, not only makes your microservices not autonomous but also their performance is impacted as soon as one of the services in that chain isn’t performing well. The more you add synchronous dependencies between microservices, such as query requests, the worse the overall response time gets for the client apps. In summary if client requests something from microservice A and this service can’t fulfill the request on its own and it talks to microservice B and consequently B needs to talk to microservice C to fulfill the request, then it means that these services are not autonomous. And if the communication between all these services in synchronous , the latency would keep on addinf with each request in the chain and if any single service fails in the chain the failure would cascade and the whole chain would fail. As shown in the above diagram, in synchronous communication a “chain” of requests is created between microservices while serving the client request. This is an anti-pattern. In asynchronous communication microservices use asynchronous messages or http polling to communicate with other microservices, but the client request is served right away. If your microservice needs to raise an additional action in another microservice, if possible, do not perform that action synchronously and as part of the original microservice request and reply operation. Instead, do it asynchronously (using asynchronous messaging or integration events, queues, etc.). But, as much as possible, do not invoke the action synchronously as part of the original synchronous request and reply operation. And finally (and this is where most of the issues arise when building microservices), if your initial microservice needs data that’s originally owned by other microservices, do not rely on making synchronous requests for that data. Instead, replicate or propagate that data (only the attributes you need) into the initial service’s database by using eventual consistency. duplicating some data across several microservices isn’t an incorrect design or anti pattern ","date":"2024-12-04","objectID":"/microservices-architecture-deep-dive-part-three-communications/:5:0","tags":["microservices","distributed systems"],"title":"Microservices Architecture Deep Dive Part Three: Communications","uri":"/microservices-architecture-deep-dive-part-three-communications/"},{"categories":["microservices"],"content":"References pipelining ↩︎ AMQP ↩︎ ","date":"2024-12-04","objectID":"/microservices-architecture-deep-dive-part-three-communications/:6:0","tags":["microservices","distributed systems"],"title":"Microservices Architecture Deep Dive Part Three: Communications","uri":"/microservices-architecture-deep-dive-part-three-communications/"},{"categories":["microservices"],"content":"In this blog post i discuss the utility of API gateways, what problem they solve? and i will also discuss the importance of BFF pattern","date":"2024-12-03","objectID":"/microservices-architecture-deep-dive-part-two--api-gateways-and-bff-pattern/","tags":["microservices","distributed systems"],"title":"Microservices Architecture Deep Dive Part Two : API Gateways and Backend For Frontend Pattern","uri":"/microservices-architecture-deep-dive-part-two--api-gateways-and-bff-pattern/"},{"categories":["microservices"],"content":"API gateway is a common pattern majority of microservices out in the world follow, to address some issues and Backend for frontend is a pattern which is a natural extension of API gateway pattern which helps the microservices scale very smoothly.

Imagine yourself being a frontend engineer and you are creating the UI for the ecommerce application, you go to the backend engineer and ask him that you are developing the login experience what API endpoint should you use on the client side? and the backend engineer would tell you that the Authentication Service is the one which would handle the login, so they give you the endpoint for authentication service, now after some days you start developing the Cart functionality on the frontend and you get to know from the backend team that, you would need to make use of two more microservices the payment and shipping service to implement that and this continues for the life time of the project. Do you see the problem? The clients are directly communicating with the microservices, utilizing the API exposed by the services, and this is a problem, the client is highly coupled with the backend services, if some endpoint changes the client would need to change too. and coupling is bad as i discussed in my last post. We need an abstraction between the clients and the services, and that abstraction is API Gateway. The API gateways sits between the clients and services and now clients only need to know about the gateway and only talk to it, the clients don’t need to worry about hundreds of services to talk to, gateway will handle that. This also decouples the clients from services, because now microservices can change all they want to change and client won’t need changing because now there is a level of indirection between clients and services.

Now that gateway is the entrypoint for our infra we can accomodate the cross cutting features in the gateway itself, because these features are required by all the services in the infra, obviously it would be a madness to implement these for each service individually in different techstacks. Following sections will go into some of the features API Gateways implement (the features which are commonly attributed to API gateways) Authentication This is the major and obvious one, every microservice needs some kind of authentication and identity management, so why do it separately for every service, so the common pattern is to have authentication placed in an Edge Service like API Gateway. Protocol Translation As i did discuss in the last post one of the advantage of having microservices is flexibility with choosing the technology for the implementation of the service, one microservice can have an REST api, one could have graphQL the other could have a grpc implemented. If clients want to talk to them, they have to speak all these languages (protocols) to implement the client side successfully which is madness. So API gateway solves this problem as well by sitting between the services and clients, it acts as a protocol interpreter because as services are only talking to the gateway they only need to speak one protocol mainly REST and API gateway would take care of talking to diverse services in diverse protocols. Rate Limiting Another cross cutting concern is rate limiting, API gateway can implement the cutting edge rate limiting algorithms on the edge instead of these algorithms being part of every service which saves us from redundancy. Request Routing and Load Balancing API gateway is also responsible to Route incoming API requests to appropriate backend services based on the request path, headers, or other criteria. API gateway is also used to implement the load balancer for the services to Distribute traffic across multiple service instances for high availability and load balancing. Caching API gateway is naturally a good candidate for caching the service responses to reduce latency. Monitoring And Logging API gateways being the entrypoint are very suitable for the implementation of monitoring and logging solutions. whenever the gateway comes into action simply log the stuff and trigger the monitoring middleware.

We can horizontally scale the API gateway and then put a load balancer in front of it, now the clients request will come to load balancer first and then the load balancer will distribute the request among the gateways.

All these clients are different in many ways, a PC for instance has all the resources in abundance like big screen, alot of memory, big compute power e.t.c, mobiles on the other hand have small screen real estate, small memory, small compute and also limited power supply. This is the reason the backend APIs they are consuming have to be tailor made because all these clients have their own strengths and weaknesses and our goal as engineers is to exploit their strengths and mitigate the weaknesses as much as we can. The mobile clients and PC clients have different resources hence they can’t just have same API endpoints available to consume, mobile clients show limited data and try to make as few HTTP round trips to fetch data as possible because each http request drains battery and increases latency, technology like graphql is more suitable for mobiles then the HTTP REST api. Following is the depiction of difference between simple API Gateway and the gateways following the BFF architecture You see now all the clients have a tailored gateway now they will get what they need in the most efficient way possible. All the data fetching and then aggregation will now move to the tailored gateway and the client will focus on the frontend logic only.

Achieving this level of decoupling in a real world system is extremely difficult and engineers in the real world could relax this rule of microservices. nonetheless this is the most important characteristic of microservices, if you are able to achieve independent deployability for your application, you have already solved alot of problems which microservices promise to solve. And if you focus on this characteristic as the out come you would achieve numerous other benefits of microservices because independent deployability could only be achieved if you get alot of other things right.

This characteristic suggests that if service A needs some data from the database of some other microservice B, it should ask microservice B through its API to hand over the data and not share the database, this way the services will have control over what is visible to other services and what is not and access to data would be limited, and if the access to the data is limited by the API requests then service B can keep on changing e.g the schema of the database or even replace the whole database and jump from sql to no-sql database even than service A would not need to change because the API which service B is providing is the same. If we want our services to be independently deployable we need to promote backward compatibility and limit the backward incompatibility, Its that simple, but hard to achieve because you need to have a very vivid vision for the service you are designing, and you have to think in much advance what to expose and what not to expose to other services, If you make some change to a service A which is backward incompatible with the services consuming service A , all the consuming services are forced to change, so “services owning their own state” is aiming to promote backward compatibility.

This definition of size is also somewhat contentious, because every person’s ability to fit things in his or her head is different. this idea of a systems being as big as a persons head is not new, it was one of the goals of OOP as well, you design classes and encapsulate the functionality, exposing small interface of the class and giving class a name , now whenever the programmer needed to reason about the code in his head or in communication with someone else instead of mentioning the whole functionality and interface the person can alias it with the name of the class. interesting isn’t it?

Whole projects and methodologies have emerged because of this, projects like grpc is a RPC3 framework which handles all the boilerplate for fault and error handling for the services, so you don’t have to right the boilerplate and can focus on the logic of the service, and methodology like chaos testing has emerged to rigorously test the services in hostile circumstances.

The messaging queues are another good example which contribute to the service communication without being too smart, they are simple queue datastructure implementation which come with certain guarantees and aid services with async communication.

In the same way you can choose the implementation language for the service on different criterias, Golang if you want good out of the box concurrency and python if good library support is needed and concurrency is not much of a concern.

Order Service: Manages order placement and history. Inventory Service: Tracks product stock. Recommendation Service: Provides personalized product recommendations. In a monolithic architecture, all these services are part of a single application. If product recommendations experience a spike in demand (e.g., during a sale), the entire monolith must scale, even though only the Recommendation Service requires more resources. In a microservices architecture, these functionalities are separate services. Each can be independently scaled based on demand: During a sale: Recommendation Service: Scales to handle the increased load, spinning up additional instances. User Service, Order Service, and Inventory Service: Remain unaffected and do not incur extra costs.
